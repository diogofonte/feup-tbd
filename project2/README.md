# Assignment 2 - Database Technologies - FEUP 2023/2024

### Introduction

This assignment explores Object-Relational (OR) databases, which blend traditional
relational models with object-oriented concepts. We focus on leveraging SQL3 extensions to
craft a compact HR database for multinational companies. Our aim is to understand and
utilize OR database features like user-defined types, inheritance, nested tables, and sorting
methods. By integrating these, we create a flexible schema for modern HR systems.
